# Stacks and Queues

- both are linear data structures
  - allows to go through data sequentially (one by one)


- limiting - less actions can be performed on stacks and queues
  - good thing because you can assure that the user of this data structure uses it the correct way


## Stacks

- **LIFO** (last in first out)
- like a stack of plates
- most programming languages are modeled with the *stack architecture* in mind
  - function calls etc
- best implemented with arrays


## Queues

- **FIFO** (first in first out)
- like a real life queue
- whoever enters the queue first, exits the queue first
- best implemented with linked lists (in order to avoid unshifting the array)
