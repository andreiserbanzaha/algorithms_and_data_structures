# Data structures

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data


- it's important to know:
  1. how to build one
  2. how and when to use it


## Operations on data structures

- insertion
- deletion
- traversal
- search
- sort
- access


## Types of data structures

- **physical** (*arrays*, *linked lists*)
  - they define how the memory should be organized for storing the elements/data
  - related to memory


- **logical**
  - implemented based on physical data structures or combination
  - can be:
    - **linear** data structures: *stacks*, *queues*
    - **non-linear** data structures: *trees*, *graphs*
    - **tabular** data structures: *hash table*


## Abstract Data Type (ADT)

- what is a data type?
  - how is the data represented
  - what operations can be done on that data
- what is abstract in this case?
  - we create a class and the user doesn't care/know about how it's implemented
    - just use the API of the class
