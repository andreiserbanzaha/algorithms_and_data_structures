# Gettings more interviews

1. Resume
2. Linkedin
3. Portofolio
4. Email

## Resume

- employers glance about 10 seconds over a resume
- you need to increase the odds of it standing out
- don't waste more than a day on your resume
- look over the jobs you want, and add the requirements to your resume
- make it personal (add employers name on the resume)
- be 100% honest on your resume


- key points for a resume:
	- one page only
	- relevant skills
	- personalized (based on the company you are applying to)
	- online links (github, blogposts, portofolio etc)
		- even more important than the resume

- job scan: https://www.jobscan.co/
- samples: https://www.cakeresume.com/resumes
- generate resume: https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/


- you should apply for jobs that you are underqualified for
	- in order for you to grow
	- will you learn something from that job?
	- are you going to get better?
	- is this job going to be tough? then it's good!
	- dream big!


- how to improve experience
	- github (personal, open source)
	- website (personal website)
	- 1,2 big projects (few big projects > lots of small projects)
	- blogs (blogpost about a technology the company you are applying to is using)


## LinkedIn

- linkedin is kind of like a resume
- update your linkedin profile frequently
	- recruiters will most likely think that you are looking for a job
- look and apply to jobs from linkedin


## Portofolio

- a way for you to showcase your big projects, the items through you demonstrate your value
- what kind of job you want
- use a template project, don't waste too much time on it, unless you are a designer

## Email

- the best way of getting an interview is through referrals (networking)
	- not necessarily need to be a friend, you can email a person working in that company


- you can send a message directly to the head of HR or someone on the dev team and ask for an interview
- message lead devs or CTO's
	- not ask for a job, just a chat etc (people love talking about themselves)


- chrome extensions:
	- Hunter: Find email addresses in seconds
	- Find anyone's email - Contact Out
	- Email Extractor


- message example:
>Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. Iâ€™d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?
Thanks,
Yourname
Your website or any public profile link
