# Problem solving

- it's not the smartest person that gets hired (most of the time)
- it's the interviewer that is able to answer this fundamental question:
  - "will you solve the company's problem?"


- you won't get a job if:
  - if you are a genius but you can't talk to people
  - you don't work well with others
  - you write ugly code that people don't understand
  - you can't communicate a solution to a problem effectively


- it's not only about the solution to a problem in a coding interview
  - it's about the *thought process* and knowing the trade-off between:
    - data structures and algorithms
    - space and time complexity
- you have to deeply understand the trade-offs, not just memorize them
