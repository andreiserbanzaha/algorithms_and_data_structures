# Problem solving approach


## Algorithms

- what is an algorithm?
  - a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task


- why do we need to know this?
  - almost everything that you do in programming involves some kind of algorithm
  - **it's the foundation of being a successful problem solver and developer**


- how do you improve?
  1. Devise a plan for solving problems
  2. Master common problem solving patterns


## Problem solving

1. Understand the problem
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor


#### Understand the problem

- can I restate the problem in my own words?
- what are the inputs that go into the problem?
- what are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
- can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
  - do I have enough information to solve the problem?
- how should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?


#### Explore examples

- why?
  - help you understand the problem better
  - sanity checks - that your eventual solution works how it should


- start with simple examples
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with *empty* or *invalid* inputs


#### Break it down

- explicitly write down the steps that you need to take
  - this forces you to think about your code before you write it
  - catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in


#### Solve/Simplify

- find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- temporary ignore that difficulty
- write a simplified solution
- incorporate that difficulty back in


#### Look back and refactor

- congrats on solving it, but you're not done yet!


- refactoring questions:
  - can you check the result?
  - can you derive the result differently? - different (maybe better) approach
  - can you understand it at a glance?
  - can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  - can you improve the performance of your solution?
  - can you think of any other ways to refactor your code?
  - how have other people solved this problem?
