# Dynamic programming

- it is an optimization technique using **cache**
- break down a problem into a collection of sub-problems, solving those problems just once, and then storing the solution in case the sub-problem occurs again


- **memoization**
  - specific form of caching
  - a way to remember a solution to a sub-problem


- **dynamic programming = divide and conquer + memoization**


- steps to see if a problem can use dynamic programming
  1. can it be divided into a sub-problem?
  2. recursive solution
  3. are there repetitive sub-problems?
  4. memoize sub-problems
  5. demaind raise from your boss


- solutions to sub-problems can be stored (e.g. in a hash-table)
